This module allows for customization of the configuration of powerd,
the OLPC-developed power management controller.

By default, powerd will automatically suspend the XO after a period of
inactivity. If you wish to disable this behaviour, you can include the
following configuration option:

[powerd]
enable_idle_suspend=0
