This module allows you to copy files from a local directory structure into
/usr/share/library-common on the resultant system, overwriting files that
already exist.

This allows you to customize the Browse activity homepage by providing
customized versions of the files layout.tmpl and library_homepage.tmpl

Take care - this module will also let you break the homepage (e.g. it lets you
overwrite and break make_index.py)

Example configuration:
[library_homepage]
path=/home/myuser/customized-library

In the above example, the directory /home/myuser/customized-library could have
2 files including the customizations:
	/home/myuser/customized-library/layout.tmpl
	/home/myuser/customized-library/library_homepage.tmpl
